Since we ran our project on Google Colab, we didn't need to install any packages or libraries. 
However, on running the project on some other platform like jupyter notebook, one may have to install the needed libraries/ packages. 

In order to execute the project, a simple run all cells works.

All other details regarding the project are provided in the power point presentation.

Apart from that, the code has been well commented and thus, most of it is self explanatory.
